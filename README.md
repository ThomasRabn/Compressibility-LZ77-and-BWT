# Compressibility - LZ77 & BWT

## The Project

This project is about compressing files. It implements very simple versions of LZ77 and BWT compressing algorithms in order to measure their efficiency. They do not actually compress the files. However, they give a basic understanding of how the algorithms work and how much loops they have to go through.
